## Introduction

Deep learning is a subset of **machine learning** that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks. Deep learning models can learn from vast amounts of data, make decisions, and improve over time.

This tutorial will guide you through the basic concepts of deep learning, including building, training, and testing neural networks. Youâ€™ll also be provided with hands-on examples using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras**.

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms that aim to learn from data by passing it through multiple layers (or "depths") in a network of artificial neurons. These algorithms attempt to mimic the human brain and learn representations from raw data.

### Key Concepts:
- **Neural Networks**: A network of artificial neurons that process data.
- **Backpropagation**: The algorithm used to train neural networks.
- **Activation Functions**: Functions that help the network make decisions.
- **Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
- **Loss Function**: A measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual results.

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial will cover:
1. The **basics of deep learning**: What is it, how it works, and its key components.
2. **Building a neural network**: From scratch using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**.
3. **Model Training**: Learn how to train and evaluate a model.
4. **Real-world Examples**: Apply deep learning to practical problems like image classification, text generation, and more.
